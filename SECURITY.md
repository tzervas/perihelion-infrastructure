# Security Policy

## Overview

The Private Homelab GitLab Infrastructure project takes security seriously. This document outlines our security practices, vulnerability reporting procedures, and incident response protocols.

## Supported Versions

We provide security updates for the following versions:

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 1.x.x   | :white_check_mark: |
| 0.9.x   | :white_check_mark: |
| < 0.9   | :x:                |

## Security Model

### Defense in Depth

Our security architecture implements multiple layers of protection:

1. **Network Security**: Zero-trust network policies with microsegmentation
2. **Container Security**: Pod Security Standards with runtime monitoring
3. **Application Security**: Secure coding practices with automated scanning
4. **Infrastructure Security**: Hardened Kubernetes with encrypted storage
5. **Access Control**: RBAC with principle of least privilege
6. **Monitoring**: Comprehensive security event monitoring and alerting

### Threat Model

We defend against the following threat vectors:

- **External Attackers**: Unauthorized access from the internet
- **Insider Threats**: Malicious or compromised internal users
- **Supply Chain Attacks**: Compromised dependencies or container images
- **Container Breakouts**: Escape from container isolation
- **Network Lateral Movement**: Unauthorized access between services
- **Data Exfiltration**: Unauthorized access to sensitive information

## Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

### Private Disclosure

For sensitive security issues, please report privately to:

- **Email**: security@company.com
- **PGP Key**: [Download Public Key](https://keybase.io/tzervas/pgp_keys.asc)
- **Response Time**: We aim to respond within 24 hours

### What to Include

When reporting a vulnerability, please include:

1. **Description**: Clear description of the vulnerability
2. **Impact**: Potential impact and severity assessment
3. **Reproduction**: Step-by-step reproduction instructions
4. **Environment**: Affected versions and configurations
5. **Mitigation**: Suggested fixes or workarounds if known

### Example Report

```
Subject: [SECURITY] Container Privilege Escalation in Runner Controller

Description:
The GitLab runner controller allows privilege escalation through 
improper seccomp profile configuration.

Impact:
- Attackers can gain root access on worker nodes
- Potential for cluster-wide compromise
- CVSS Score: 8.5 (High)

Reproduction:
1. Deploy malicious job with specific container configuration
2. Execute privilege escalation payload
3. Gain root access to host system

Environment:
- Affected versions: 1.0.0 - 1.2.3
- Kubernetes: 1.25+
- Container runtime: Docker 24.0+

Mitigation:
Implement strict seccomp profiles and drop all capabilities
```

## Security Response Process

### Acknowledgment

- Security reports are acknowledged within 24 hours
- Initial assessment provided within 72 hours
- Regular updates provided every 7 days until resolution

### Assessment Criteria

| Severity | CVSS Score | Response Time | Patch Timeline |

3. **Day 4-30**: Investigation and patch development
4. **Day 31-45**: Testing and validation
5. **Day 46-90**: Coordinated public disclosure

## Security Best Practices

### For Contributors

#### Secure Development

```bash
# Always use security scanners before commits
make security-scan

# Sign all commits with GPG
git commit -S -m "security: implement input validation"

# Use pre-commit hooks for security checks
pre-commit install
```

#### Code Security

```python
# Always validate inputs with type hints
def process_user_input(data: str) -> bool:
    """Process user input with proper validation."""
    if not isinstance(data, str):
        raise ValueError("Input must be string")
    
    # Sanitize input
    cleaned_data = sanitize_input(data)
    
    # Validate against whitelist
    if not is_valid_input(cleaned_data):
        raise SecurityError("Invalid input detected")
    
    return process_safe_data(cleaned_data)

# Never log sensitive information
logger.info(f"Processing request for user {user_id}")  # OK
logger.debug(f"User token: {token}")  # NEVER DO THIS

# Use secrets management for credentials
password = get_secret_from_vault("database/password")
```

### For Deployments

#### Container Security

```yaml
# Security context for all containers
securityContext:
  runAsNonRoot: true
  runAsUser: 1000
  runAsGroup: 1000
  allowPrivilegeEscalation: false
  readOnlyRootFilesystem: true
  capabilities:
    drop:
      - ALL
  seccompProfile:
    type: RuntimeDefault

# Resource limits to prevent DoS
resources:
  limits:
    cpu: "1"
    memory: "1Gi"
    ephemeral-storage: "2Gi"
  requests:
    cpu: "100m"
    memory: "128Mi"
```

#### Network Security

```yaml
# Default deny network policy
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: NetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: default-deny-all
spec:
  podSelector: {}
  policyTypes:
  - Ingress
